I’m Fethi, a London-based cloud architect who has always been drawn to solving complex problems with elegant, practical solutions.

My journey began as a software engineer, and over the past 16 years I’ve worked across industries from banking to media and insurance, steadily moving closer to what excites me most: building in the cloud. Along the way, I’ve co-founded startups, designed SaaS products from the ground up, and helped global enterprises modernize their systems with AWS and serverless technologies.

What drives me is the challenge of turning ambitious ideas into secure, scalable realities — whether that’s launching a new platform for a young company or reimagining infrastructure for an established one. Outside of tech, I find balance in music, especially classical guitar, where I’m reminded that creativity and discipline go hand in hand.
