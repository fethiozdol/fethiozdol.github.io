I'm excited to share that I've joined Vehicularis Ltd as a Co-Founder!

We're building a mobile app that aims to empower cars and elevate journeys.

As I'm going to be working on a new project from scratch, I've decided to stop working on the blog series "Kickstarting Your Startup with DevOps from Day Zero" and start a new series based on my experiences and insights gained while building this app.
